##Rails4 + AngularJS 1.5

 This is just a fork of [kirandc's very good example](https://github.com/kirandc/rails4_crud_with_angularjs) of putting together Rails 4 an AngularJS. I've forked it to match the example to my needs:

 1. haml templates
 * coffescript
 * mixed client and server side validation
 * use of Rails' I18N inside AngularJS
 * use Rails simple form views and AngularJS views in one app
 
Not all of theese targets have been achived yet. By now we're working at item 4.
